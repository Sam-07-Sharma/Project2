        Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience.


Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger than things farther away, we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.


The illusion has been long adopted into parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic effect. Its first use was in traditional animation, dating back to as early as Disneyâ€™s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and in video games such as Super Mario. 


With advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax effects later evolved into the world of web design as we know it today.

        From hauntingly beautiful snowy escapades to lush forests and hills of rolling green, 
        from the endless golden beaches to the sapphire and emerald lakes embedded in the landscape, 
        the natural beauty of the Indian subcontinent is unparalleled. 
        The unspoilt and unexplored terrains of the country leave one in awe of their breathtaking splendour. 
        Moreover, the differences and contrasts of one region from another accentuate 
        the appeal of these landscapes - be it the frigid cold deserts of Leh that call to the soul-searcher in 
        you or the sun-drenched mystique desert dunes of Rajasthan that take you back to the times of royals. 
        Starting from the snow-capped Himalayas in the north, traversing the deserts of Rajasthan, 
        crossing the lush forests of Madhya Pradesh and then sailing in the expansive backwaters of Kerala, 
        and finally diving into the pristine waters of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 
        the journey is full of adventurous highlands and serene plains and lowlands.

        Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.

        The quote by Albert Einstein, "Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better,
        " encapsulates a profound truth about the interconnectedness and wisdom that nature holds. 
        At first glance, the quote implies that by immersing ourselves in nature and observing its intricacies, 
        we can gain a deeper understanding of the world around us. 
        By contemplating the marvels of the natural world, we can unravel mysteries, find solutions, 
        and gain insights into the complex workings of the universe. 
        This sentiment highlights the importance of viewing nature not merely as a backdrop, 
        but as a teacher and a source of enlightenment.Nature has long been a subject of fascination for 
        philosophers, scientists, and spiritual seekers alike. Its vast diversity, 
        the delicate balance of ecosystems, and the harmony of its living organisms offer a wealth of
         knowledge waiting to be discovered.
